# Introduction

## Reviewer Tools on ATN <a href="#docs-internal-guid-29d69a32-7fff-78e1-bc88-79710dc5b1d9" id="docs-internal-guid-29d69a32-7fff-78e1-bc88-79710dc5b1d9"></a>

The [reviewer tools](https://addons.thunderbird.net/reviewers/) available on addons.thunderbird.net (ATN) are the central utilities for managing add-on reviews. Key features include:

* **Overview Page:** Lists add-ons waiting for review, organized into multiple queues—for example, separate queues for new add-ons and for add-on updates.
* **Validation Report:** Displays the results of the pre-analysis for each add-on, providing helpful context during the review process.
* **File Viewer:** Diff between different add-on versions. Validation results are shown inline within the viewer for easier reference.

Most of the reviewer tools pages are fairly straightforward, but we have prepared a video that will give you an introduction to the tools. We recommend taking a moment to watch it now.

### Overview page

After logging in to the [reviewer tools](https://addons.thunderbird.net/reviewers/), you will see an index page:\

The links in the left column will open the [queue pages](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/reviewers/queue/) explained in the next section. “Performance” links will show some reviewer statistics, and the “Review Log” links will list information about recent add-on reviews.
